 *    Let P be a 2D point expressed in a plane area defined by
 *    four 2D points A,B,C,D. The aim of the class called
 *    "Cadre(.hh|.cc)" is to express the coordinates of P in
 *    order to match when A,B,C,D is rectified as a rectangle.
 *    
 *    This program is a demo application which shows the use
 *    of the "Cadre" C++ class. The window is divided in two
 *    parts. On the left, a drawing area shows the source
 *    quadrilateral, which can be modified using four handles.
 *    On the right, a drawing area shows the destination
 *    rectangle. The position of the mouse cursor on the left
 *    area is mapped on the right view after rectification to
 *    match with the rectangle.
